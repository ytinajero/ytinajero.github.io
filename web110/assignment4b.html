  <h1> Assignment 4b: Security</h1>
  <h2> Lesson Summary (1)- Password Managers</h2>
    <p>In the activity, “Research password managers and multi-factor authentication,” I was tasked with the following: 1) Setting up a password manager, 2) Using multifactor authentication. What I learned is that password managers are software programs that generate or save passwords for web applications like social media or more general uses like online shopping. These can either be already built-in to a website, like Instagram or Facebook, or even iCloud Keychain. These are relatively easy to use since the password managers suggest easy-to-remember, strong passwords. For multi-factor authentication (MFA), it’s a security system that requires the user to verify their identity AFTER putting in their password. Sometimes it involves one “factor” or multiple. This can be anything like a code that can only be sent to your phone, a personal security question, or just another password. I already know how to set these up, but I should probably update my passwords to make them more difficult to access!</p>
  <h2> Lesson Summary (2)- Setting up a Firewall</h2>
    <p>In the activity “Test your firewall using a testing service such as Gibson Research: ShieldsUP!”, I was tasked with: 1) Testing my firewall using the service mentioned in the activity. I learned today that my computer data isn’t protected at all. The website, Gibson Research: ShieldsUP!, is a research corporation helping inform online users if their firewall is secure enough on the internet. After realizing mine wasn’t, I was given info on how firewalls work and why i should buy one. I learned that firewalls are basically your own “wall of code” that protects your computer from the internet by selecting packets of information and determining whether or not they can pass or be blocked. After learning about how efficient firewalls are at protecting your computers data, I checked to see if I have any already pre-installed on my MacBook. Turns out I do and just have to flip the switch!</p>
