    <h2>What I learned in Assignment 6a...</h2>
    <p>In completing the activities involving setting up an /images in my repository- I ran into an issue. That is- not uploading my desired .jpg file to my repository first. I kept on trying to drag and drop it into my github studio dev, /image folder, but would always say an error of some sort. Other than that, this assignment has been pretty interesting. I learned how to correctly input the right command for a image, audio, or video link into my html layout. And I got to uplaod my favorite meme from a videogame I love onto my own website. Overall, I'm enjoying with creating something of my own. </p>
