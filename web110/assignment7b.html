    <h1>Assignment 7b: Databases</h1>
    <p>In this activity, I learned how complex and intimidating databases can be until you delelop a familiarity with the pattern that occurs while navigating through each table. There's a lot of going back and forth between tables like looking for the CustomerID in the Order ID table tht way we can identify the ShipperID the customer used for their order. It's mailny in developing a rythym of your when looking for specific information about a customer, employee, product, etc. While it may seem tedious and feel like it'll take forever- it's honestly a well-organized system that won't be inaccurate. So I believe it should be kept that way. I learned that databases are extremely important as they are essential in keeping information in an organized fashion. This will be helpful to me in the future as I take upon a position in my career that requires me to organize inventory, clientele info, and orders of any kind I have made. </p>
