    <p>In this specific activity, "Configure Browser Settings", of Wiki University,it was instructing me to basically mess around with the settings of various browsers- according to my own preference. These browsers I experimented with are: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Safari (No Opera since it wasn't installing). Of course, the settings I would be messing around with would be changing the appearance of the browser as a whole either using extensions or built-in themes, privacy and security, adding bookmarks, tabs, and such- aswell as customizing how you choose to interact with the browser. In navigating through the settings of each of these browsers, I noticed how minimalistic and user-friendly they are to use. They all follow an aesthetic similar to Chrome's UI, which makes it easier to select certain panels in the settings you wish to change. And of course, each one is customizable if you wish to use a theme that is already built-in or from the webstore. In the user and privacy settings I noticed in pretty much all of them- is that they have a "standard" or "strict" mode. Standard being minimal blockage of security threats and more access- strict being total blockage of security threates but chances of not being able to access certain sites. Also each have their own form of AI assistance such as Brave's Leo or Edge's Co Pilot. In using these AI assistants, I realized how efficient each one is in getting results faster according to the search engine I'm using. Overall, exploring these browsers helped to realize how unique each one is in their own right, like Brave having its own built-in VPN, while retaining important, core "not-going-anywhere" items like easy customization. This information will help me in finding the right browser for me (which right now, I'm leaning towards firefox).  </p>
