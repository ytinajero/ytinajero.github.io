    <h1> Assignment 2a: Exploring Browsers</h1>
    <h2> Lesson Summary- "Configuring Browser Settings"</h2>
    <p>In this specific activity, "Configure Browser Settings", of Wiki University,it was instructing me to basically mess around with the settings of various browsers- according to my own preference. These browsers I experimented with are: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Safari (No Opera since it wasn't installing). Of course, the settings I would be messing around with would be changing the appearance of the browser as a whole either using extensions or built-in themes, privacy and security, adding bookmarks, tabs, and such- aswell as customizing how you choose to interact with the browser. In navigating through the settings of each of these browsers, I noticed how minimalistic and user-friendly they are to use. They all follow an aesthetic similar to Chrome's UI, which makes it easier to select certain panels in the settings you wish to change. And of course, each one is customizable if you wish to use a theme that is already built-in or from the webstore. In the user and privacy settings I noticed in pretty much all of them- is that they have a "standard" or "strict" mode. Standard being minimal blockage of security threats and more access- strict being total blockage of security threates but chances of not being able to access certain sites. Also each have their own form of AI assistance such as Brave's Leo or Edge's Co Pilot. In using these AI assistants, I realized how efficient each one is in getting results faster according to the search engine I'm using. Overall, exploring these browsers helped to realize how unique each one is in their own right, like Brave having its own built-in VPN, while retaining important, core "not-going-anywhere" items like easy customization. This information will help me in finding the right browser for me (which right now, I'm leaning towards firefox).  </p>

    <h2> Lesson Summary- Configuring Browser Extensions and Add-ons</h2>
    <p>In this activity, it was asking to view any extensions or add-ons I have already installed in my native browser (safari) and to explore for popular ones to consider using. When cheching if I had any installed, I wasn't surprsied I didn't have any installed. So I set out exploring the web for add-ons to install and just referenced a reddit thread for popular web extensions to use. From what Iv'e seen so far was extensions like Bitwarden which saves your login information in a secure manner. Dark Reader which just turns the theme pf your web browser black so it can be easier on your eyes. And of course, Grammarly, which is know for checking your spelling or grammar in real-time. These are just a few that grabbed my interest and have already tried out and liked. Ever since exploring all these different web extensions, I came to the conclusion that not all are needed and are just up to the user's preference. The web extensions are a necessary thing to use but definitely helpful if the user wants to make their browsing experience more effiecient in the manner they want it. </p>
