    <h1>Assignment 2b: Search Engines</h1>
    <h2>Lesson Summary- "Comparing Search Engines" </h2>
    <p>In the activity of comparing search engines, it asked to type out the prompt “web search engine” in each of the following search engines: Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask- and then compare them in terms of usefulness and ui design. After searching your query, I noticed that all were relatively similar in a minimalistic aesthetic. However, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask all had clutter on the homepage before searching your query, which felt like an information overload. Google was the only one with a search engine, surrounded by basically nothing. When searching the prompt, Google gave a result assisted by an AI overview, which made things simpler. Yahoo and Bing provided explanations taken from Wikipedia, while Ask had you scavenge for the result you desired. The Google search engine proved to be most useful as it gave me the results I ASKED for with no need to nitpick. Also, the activity asked me to type in the prompt “search engine market share” into my native search engine (which was Google). Currently, the Google search engine is dominating with a 79.1% market share on desktop devices.<p>
    <h2>Lesson Summary- "Search Engine Optimization"</h2>
    <p>In the next activity I did, I was tasked with learning Search Engine Optimization. It was instructed to review “Google: Get Your Content on Google.” And view helpful information on their learning about SEO. What I learned is that SEO is essentially a tool or checklist in helping the developer of a website make sure their site is “attractive” and appropriate enough to be more noticeable in the results of a search engine. Things that the developer can check to make their website more noticeable are using HTML, as it's the standard language every web page uses, which makes it more accessible. And it could also include keywords in the URL of the webpage to make it easier for users to search. And overall, organizing the layout of a web page to make it seem neat and clean for users to navigate through. I never knew that web pages followed a protocol like SEO, so this is definitely a checklist I can follow in the future when I want to build my webpage!</p>
