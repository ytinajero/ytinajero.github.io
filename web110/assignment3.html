    <p>In the activity “Send, receive, and respond to email”, it tasked me with:  1) making a Gmail account, 2) sending an email message, 3) responding to an email message. Although I’m pretty familiar with using my email on my day-to-day basis, there were a few things I learned. First and foremost, I didn’t know clicking on the “To” button, before typing in a recipient, pulled up a list of all the people I have added in my Gmail. Also, learned the abbreviations of Cc and Bcc- “carbon copy” and “blind carbon copy”. Both have their functions where Cc lets the recipients know that they aren’t the only person that received an email- Bcc hides the recipients name. These were the two essential things I learned that were most important, and new, to me. For that, I can now navigate more easily in sending an email and improve my use in it professionally in the business world.

In the activity, “Use internet mailing lists”, it tasked me with: 1) researching popular internet mailing lists, 2) signing up for one that interested me, 3) researching its restrictions and identifying appropriate ways to send bulk email messages. I learned is that there are mailing lists out there such as Google Groups, Mailman, Mailchimp, Substack, and so on. And essentially what mailing lists are is essentially a giant groupchat that uses a single email address where everyone receives the email right then and there- all in one place. It’s pretty convenient for businesses but can be rather pricey to use- depending which one you are using. For that, I’m leaning towards Google Group because its free, user-friendly, and overall just easy to use. Lastly, the common restrictions set-in-stone for internet mailing lists are that follows: 1) limited sending (from 500-2000 recipients/day, depending on the provider), 2) anti-spam laws (no misleading titles, visible unsubscribe link, proof of identification), 3) email content filters (don’t too many links, don’t use irritable words like “FREE”, and neglecting the use of large images). The knowledge I gathered from this activity will give me a better understanding of how to detect spam mail in the mailing lists I use and how to setup a mailing list the appropriate, correct manner.

In the activity, “Review Smart Insights: The Honeycomb Model”, I was tasked with: 1) evaluating social media sites based on the Honeycomb Model, 2) select which sites support the full honeycomb model, 3) select which sites are lacking elements. Firstly, the Honeycomb Model is based on seven building blocks that indicate wether or not the social media site is interactive for its users. The seven building blocks are: identity, presence, relationships, reputation, groups, conversations, and sharing. So far the sites that I reviewed that fully support the honeycomb model are; FaceBook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Snapchat. I wasn’t surprised that these sites fully-supported the honeycomb model since there’s always a way to interact with others on there with no restriction. The sites that lacked elements of the honeycomb model however are: Pinterest, Tumblr, Twitter, and Youtube. The common element they lacked was Groups, which is the most essential that allows real-time, personal interaction between users. The knowledge I gained from this activity is that not every social media platform will support the honeycomb model 100%. However, that doesn’t mean its a bad thing. In today’s world, everyone has several accounts that stretch do different social media platforms because each of them hasand element the other doesn’t. It all boils down to preference. 

In the activity, “Intellectual Property”, I was tasked with: 1) reviewing RIAA: About Privacy, 2) researcching legal issues and potential penalties related to illegal peer-to-peer file sharing. Looking on the RIAA website’s “about privacy”, I learned that copyright laws are no joke. I’ve seen them all the time when watching a movie at home on disc. I mean, it makes sense. No one wants their creative work to be copied and potentially sold by another stranger. Back to the topic, making unauthorized copies of copyrighted music recordings can leave you with a felony record, up to five years of jail time, and fines up to $250,000! Also, in a nutshell, sharing any kind of unauthorized music online is copyright infringement. Lastly, there is a grey area where if your burning a cd for yourself, from an authorized original cd- it’s considered for personal use and isn’t copyright infringement. Knowing all these copyright regulations really made me more aware of what sites to trust further down the road if I want to download any of my favorite music.
