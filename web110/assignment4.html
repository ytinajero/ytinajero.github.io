    <h1>Assignment 4a: Networking</h1>
    <h2> Lesson Summary (1)- Sharing a Folder</h2>
    <p>In the activity “Share a folder and connect to the shared folder”, I was tasked with: 1) sharing a folder on my system, 2) connecting to the folder from another computer. I learned that there is a simple process behind sharing a file with a different user from another computer. However, this process varies depending on your software- I’m running macOS. For mine, I have to go into System Preferences -> Sharing -> Enable File Sharing and add the users I want to a folder I have selected. In knowing this new method to share my files, I can share my Adobe files for my GRA classes to my home Mac- that way I can have a backup on a different drive, under a different user.</p>
    <h2>Lesson Summary (2)- Researching and Comparing Windows, macOS, and Linux </h2>
    <p>In the activity “Research and compare license and support costs for Windows, macOS, and Linux”, I was tasked, well with researching the criteria I mentioned before. What I learned is that Windows and MacOS already come pre-installed (free) for the average consumer- this differs for Windows since if you build your own PC, you need to get a standalone retail license to install Windows as your native platform. For Linux, it’s an open-source that anyone can install on their own at no extra charge. For an enterprise license, however, Windows and Linux have a fee of $100-$1000, not macOS at all. With this info, I learned that I’ve been lucky to have the companies behind creating these beautiful, technical machines, like Dell, HP, Apple, and Asus, pay for the licensing fees for their users, so they don't have to struggle through.</p>
