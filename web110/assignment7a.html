    <h2>Expectations and Outcomes</h2>
    <p>For my final project topic, I'm going to be explaing the role of CSS when it comes to web page design. Most importantly, I will be going over what css is, why its important, the benefits of implementing css, types of css- along with showing examples of what css can do. Also explaining the moedern CSS features and it's positive impact on accessibility. This will all be explained in the span of ten minutes- presented on google slides through a recording.</p>
    <h2>What I Learned During This Activity...</h2>
    <p>During my completion of this assignment, I realized how important setting up a structure of deadlines is when it comes to meeting them for yourself. It gives me, or the designer, accountability and responsibility to follow when completing a presentation of any kind to present in front of a client. Using the gantt chart and table aided in setting up these deadlines and expectations. So in a way, setting up those two serve as examples for creating outlines for "what's next for my HTML and CSS code", "when should I have my desired images imported"- and so on. This will heavily benefit me when I need to meet quotas during my career as a graphic designer.</p>
