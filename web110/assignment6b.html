    <h1>Assignment 6a: Web Accessibility</h1>
    <h2>Learning Summary (1)- Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>In the activity, "Review Mozilla: What is accessibility?", I was tasked with learning about the importance of accessibility and why it's THE number one priority to consider when laying out your web page, HTML and CSS code. A few important thigs I learned when making a web page more acessible to those that have visual or hearing impairments is providing a screen-reader, a digital magnifier to zoom in on text, and transcripts video content. These are essential when it comes to those that have sensory issues. All the while these tools are important- using the appropiate fonts, color contrast, and layout is crucial in not overwhleming the user. This also applies to HTML and CSS code as well- more so the structure and formatting. This applies to using appropiate spacing between lines of code to make it legible to read, using appropiate elements, leaving notes to make the sections make sense. Learning this was truy helpful as now I'm being more considerate of users with physical or cognitive impairment. Being more mindful in my structure of code will benefit both me and the user! </p>
