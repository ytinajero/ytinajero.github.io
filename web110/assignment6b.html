    <h1>Assignment 6b: Web Accessibility</h1>
    <h2>Learning Summary (1)- Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>In the activity, "Review Mozilla: What is accessibility?", I was tasked with learning about the importance of accessibility and why it's THE number one priority to consider when laying out your web page, HTML and CSS code. A few important thigs I learned when making a web page more acessible to those that have visual or hearing impairments is providing a screen-reader, a digital magnifier to zoom in on text, and transcripts video content. These are essential when it comes to those that have sensory issues. All the while these tools are important- using the appropiate fonts, color contrast, and layout is crucial in not overwhleming the user. This also applies to HTML and CSS code as well- more so the structure and formatting. This applies to using appropiate spacing between lines of code to make it legible to read, using appropiate elements, leaving notes to make the sections make sense. Learning this was truy helpful as now I'm being more considerate of users with physical or cognitive impairment. Being more mindful in my structure of code will benefit both me and the user! </p>
    <h2>Learning Summary (2)- Writing Good Alt Text</h2>
    <p>In the activity, "Review SuperCoolDesign: How To Write Good Alt Text", I was tasked with verifying what kind of ALT tags are apporpiate to use in images and multimedia. The main point to take away from this lesson, essentially, is to keep ALT tag descriptions short, sweet, and specific- unless the image or multimedia requires further descriptive detail. For example, a picture of a catfish eating. What is it eating? That's where the ALT text comes in. Knowing what I learned now, I would use an ALT text of "Catfish eating clams". Short and sweet. Whereas for somehting more complex- it's the opposite. Like a famous painting. For example, The Creation of Adam- Michelangelo. Where you can not only just add the title of the painting and painter but also adding depth. Like "The Creation of Adam painted by Michelangelo, displayed in the Sistine Chapel." This lesson has been very informative in using the appropiate amount of text in an ALT tag when describing an image or multimedia. This will be helpful to me when I need to display my own images on my webpage. </p>
