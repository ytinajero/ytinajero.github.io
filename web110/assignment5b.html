  <h2>Learning Summary</h2>
  <p>
    What I learned in this lesson is the basic fundamentals of CSS. I realized how simple it can all be put together if you follow the structure accordingly- and from there, you're free to customize to your liking! And to makes things easier when changing the style of your pages to look the same, you have to input a link in the assignment that references "style.css". This link can be applied to all the other assignments to have the same layout. Also, its about putting the tags between brackets first for the attributes you want for your text or background, and then putting those tags behind the "p" tags so they can correctly be applied and working when you open the pages. This lesson has been very eye-opening for me as you do need patience and double-checking as inputting tags and certain terms really matter when you want certain links to work accordingly.</p>
