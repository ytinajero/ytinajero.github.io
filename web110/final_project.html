    <h2>Lesson Summary...</h2>
    <p>My experience in this web development class has been great! At first, I was intimidated by learning that actual coding was involved in this course but overtime_ I realized how interesting and fun this came out to be. Learning how the web works, building my own "website", learning the history of the web and its evolution made my expections of this course met! There's not much to really say as I'm running on 4 hours of sleep and just want to finish this paragraph. I learned a lot and enjoyed a lot- I'll just leave it there.</p>
