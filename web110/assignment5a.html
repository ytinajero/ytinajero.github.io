    <h1>Assignment 5a: What I learned...</h1>
    <p>While completing these HTML activities, I learned that in order to understand in how to create a website- you must understand the tags. For example, "ul" is unordered list and helps start bulleted list which then is followed by using "li"- which is "list item". This helps in adding an item to that list. A lot of the tags are abbreviations just like these two so it makes it easier to understand the significance of these items. Another things I learned is the differences between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. What best described each one's purpose is following the metaphor of: HTML is the structure- the bones, what really builds the frame of the website. CSS is the clothes- what gives the website its unique appearance. And Java Script beinig the behavior- how the website will function when the user intereacts with it. Overall, this lesson has been very interesting and I am no somewhat familiar with the basics of building a website.</p>
